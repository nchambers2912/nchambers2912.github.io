# About Talkfit

Based in Southampton, we help individuals from the age of 11 years old who are suffering from psychological distress. We believe that you are the expert in your own life, as such we aim to help in a respectful, non-judgemental way, age regardless.
​
We also work with organisations who provide respite care for families in need. Person-Centred counselling encourages autonomy and self-care in individuals, enabling them to think about their problems in a different way. If you are a company who provides care and are interested in providing confidential counselling, then please contact us to arrange a convenient appointment. At this time we will discuss health and safety arrangements and how the service will work in your company.
