Phone us on the number below for an initial chat. If you’re happy to go ahead we can book your appointment time.

As the counsellor's day consists of seeing clients in a confidential setting there may be times when you will need to leave a message. If this is the case please let me know how I can get in touch with you.

You may feel uncomfortable for messages to be left on your phone, so let me know what’s best for you. I can respond by email, text or What’s App; it’s your choice. We can then find a suitable, private time which is convenient for you to talk.

I aim to get back to you within 24 hours. At this time, please let me know if you have any restraining factors that would prevent you from coming to your appointment such as a disability or transport problem.

Talkfit Counselling Services are situated in Sportfit Support Services Ltd. May we respectfully ask that you park in the 2 hours free parking situated on the road. The car park is designated for Sportfit Staff.
