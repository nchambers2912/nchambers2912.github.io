# Frequently Asked Questions

Q - Do you keep records of our sessions?
A - Yes, the BACP advise to keep appropriate, accurate, respectful records. These records are coded and cannot be linked to your name. They are also held securely under lock and key in adherence with General Data Protection Regulations.

Q - May I see my records?
A - Yes, you have the right to see your records under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

Q - Do you work with everyone?
A - Our counsellor works with clients from the age of 11. This is because ethically we feel we do not have the necessary training to work with anyone under this age. Over this age we work with any group of client and do not discriminate on grounds of gender, sexual orientation or gender reassignment, religion or belief, race or disability.

Q - Do you hold a Disclosure and Barring Service check?
A - Our counsellor is a member of the DBS Update Service. This means that the DBS check is always current and in date.

Q - You mention that we will establish a contract when we first meet. What does this mean?
A - The contract sets out ethical and legal considerations for counselling. It provides guidelines so that we are both safe within our work. We will also cover what to do should you wish to complain about Talkfit Counselling Services or its employees.

Q - Will all information be kept strictly confidential?
A - We are required by the BACP to have regular supervision and will need to discuss our work with a qualified supervisor. We will not disclose your name or anything that would enable you to be identified. There are other circumstances where we are required to disclose information. This may involve a personal disclosure or a disclosure about a third party. We will always talk to you about how this will be dealt with before action.
These instances are:
Acts of terrorism either being planned or which have already taken place. This is subject to The Terrorism Act 2000.
Acts of harm to children. This is subject to The Childrenâ€™s Act 1989.
If you disclose an act of harm to self or others.
Money Laundering Regulations - Money laundering means exchanging money or assets that were obtained criminally for money or other assets that are legal. This is subject to The Drug Trafficking Act 1994.
If we are compelled to reveal information by a court order.

Ethics and the law surrounding confidentiality are complex. I am happy to talk through any doubts you may have about when your confidentiality could be breached. I find that once the limits to confidentiality have been fully explored the client feels free to talk about whatever brought them to counselling in the first place.
